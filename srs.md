Software Architecture for a Media Management
Here’s a scalable and robust architecture tailored for managing images and videos:
1. High-Level Architecture Diagram
The system is divided into the following layers:
● Client Layer
● API Gateway Layer
● Microservices Layer
● Database Layer
● Storage Layer
2. Components of the Architecture
A. Client Layer
● Applications:
○ Web Application (React, Angular, or Vue.js) for administrators, teachers, and
parents.
○ Mobile App (Flutter or React Native) for easier access and uploads.
● Features:
○ Event dashboard: List events and associated media.
○ Upload media with metadata (tags, descriptions, dates).
○ Search media using tags or event names.
B. API Gateway
● Purpose:
○ Acts as a single entry point for all client requests.
○ Manages authentication, request routing, and rate-limiting.
● Technology:
○ Kong, AWS API Gateway, or Nginx.
● Features:
○ Authentication and Authorization (OAuth 2.0 / JWT).
○ Routing requests to the appropriate microservices.
C. Microservices Layer
The core of the application, each service handles a specific domain. Below are key
microservices:
1. User Management Service:
○ Handles user roles (admin, teacher, student, parent).
○ Authentication and SSO integration.
2. Media Management Service:
○ Manages media uploads, metadata, and retrieval.
○ Implements features like compression and tagging.
3. Event Management Service:
○ Stores event details (e.g., name, date, participants).
○ Links media to events.
4. Search and Indexing Service:
○ Indexes metadata for fast searches using tags or event names.
○ Technology: Elasticsearch or OpenSearch.
5. Analytics Service:
○ Provides insights on storage usage, most accessed media, etc.
6. Notification Service:
○ Sends notifications (email/SMS) for event updates or new uploads.
○ Integration: Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for emails.
7. Billing and Subscription Service:
○ Manages subscription plans for schools.
○ Tracks storage quotas and usage.
D. Database Layer
● Relational Database:
○ Technology: PostgreSQL or MySQL.
○ Stores structured data like users, events, and media metadata.
● NoSQL Database:
○ Technology: MongoDB or DynamoDB.
○ Stores unstructured data like logs or application-specific configurations.
● Search Database:
○ Technology: Elasticsearch or OpenSearch.
○ Optimized for media search by metadata.
E. Storage Layer
● Cloud Storage:
○ Technology: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.
○ Stores images and videos.
○ Implements lifecycle policies (e.g., archiving older media).
● CDN Integration:
○ Technology: CloudFront, Akamai, or Azure CDN.
○ Ensures fast delivery of media globally.
● Backup & Disaster Recovery:
○ Automate backups of both database and media storage.
○ Redundant storage across multiple regions.
F. DevOps and CI/CD
● Containerization:
○ Dockerize all microservices for portability.
● Orchestration:
○ Kubernetes for managing containers and scaling services.
● CI/CD Pipeline:
○ Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
○ Automates testing, building, and deployment.
● Monitoring:
○ Tools: Prometheus and Grafana for performance monitoring.
○ Logs: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki.
3. Data Flow
1. Media Upload:
○ A user uploads media via the client app → API Gateway → Media Management
Service.
○ The service validates the request, processes metadata, and stores the file in
cloud storage.
2. Search and Retrieval:
○ The user searches for an event → Request is routed to the Search Service.
○ Metadata is queried from Elasticsearch, and file links are retrieved from storage.
3. Event Management:
○ Admin creates an event → Event details are saved in the relational database.
○ Associated media files are linked to this event.
4. Notification Flow:
○ When new media is uploaded, a notification is triggered to users via the
Notification Service.
